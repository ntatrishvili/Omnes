# Omnes 

**Omnes** is an energy system modelling platform that lets you transform structured datasets into solvable energy models using a simple configuration and processing pipeline. Built for flexibility and clarity, Omnes supports modular data uploads, transformation, and model execution â€” currently with support for the **Gurobi** solver.

---

## Features

- Upload data files to the `data/` folder to describe your energy system (e.g., technologies, resources, demands)
- Easily configure the time set, resolution, and model settings via `config.ini`
- Transform input data into a model-ready format
- Run your custom optimization script with full Gurobi integration
- Modular design for experimenting with different models and solvers (Gurobi supported currently)

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ntatrishvili/Omnes.git
cd Omnes
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> Note: You must have a working [Gurobi license](https://www.gurobi.com/downloads/end-user-license-agreement-academic/) and `gurobipy` installed.

### 3. Add your data

Place your system definition files (CSV, Excel, etc.) into the `data/` folder. These files represent your technologies, time series, costs, and other elements.

### 4. Configure model settings

Edit `config.ini` to set your **time resolution**, **frequency**, and other options:

```ini
[time]
time_set = 10000
frequency = H  # e.g., H for hourly, D for daily
```

### 5. Run the model

```bash
python main.py
```

This will transform the input data, build your energy system model, and run it using your configured script in `operation/`.

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- [Gurobi](https://www.gurobi.com/) (Academic or commercial license)
- `gurobipy`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `configparser`, etc. (see `requirements.txt`)
